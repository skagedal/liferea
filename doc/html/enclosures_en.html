	<h3>Enclosures/Podcasting</h3>

	<h4>What is this all about?</h4>
	
	<p>
	Some weblogs and news feeds want to provide you with more than
	just ASCII text or HTML formatted articles. A weblog author might
	want to record his daily experiences and publish them as audio
	data (often MP3) and of course make this available in the weblog's
	feed too. This is done by adding <b>enclosures</b> to feed items. Adding
	an enclosure means adding an URL to an item which the feed reader
	application can download and play with an appropriate media 
	player.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Feeds with audio content are often called <b>podcasts</b>.
	The act of publishing such content is called <b>podcasting</b>.
	The Wikipedia page about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">podcasting</a> is a good start to learn more about this
	publishing method.
	</p>

	<p>
	Including audio content might be the most common use case
	for enclosures but there are other feeds around containing images,
	torrents or videos. Every data format is thinkable.
	</p>

	<h4>How Liferea downloads enclosures</h4>

	<p>
	Per default Liferea does not automatically download enclosures.
	But you can enable auto-downloading for each feed separately.
	If a new enclosure is found Liferea will then start a download
	using the <a href="preferences_en.html#enclosures">configured download method</a>. All
	downloaded files will be stored into the <a href="preferences_en.html#enclosures">configured
	download directory</a>. After viewing the contents you have to
	delete them manually.
	</p>

	<p>Of course you can also <b>manually download</b> enclosures.
	To do so open the item with the enclosure and click the 
	arrow to open the enclosure context menu. There are two
	option. The first one downloads and launches the file
	while the second option save the file into a specified
	directory.
	</p>

	<h4>How Liferea opens enclosures</h4>

	<p>
	After downloading a file Liferea will try to launch the file
	according to it's MIME type or file extension. The application
	used to view or play the downloaded file can be <a href="preferences_en.html#enclosures">configured in the program preferences</a>.
	Note that it depends on the feed whether you can use MIME types
	to associate launcher programs or if you must rely on the
	file extension to do this.
