	<h3>Program Preferences</h3>

	<p> The preferences dialog can be opened by the toolbar or
	through the "Program" menu. The dialog is divided into seven tabs
	described in the following text.  </p>

	<h4>Feed Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_feeds_1.6.0.png">
	</p>
	<ul>
	
	<li>
	<b>Feed Cache Handling:</b> Here you can set the default number 
	of items to be saved for each subscription. Note that this setting
	can be overwritten for each subscription by setting the item cache
	size in the subscriptions properties.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Feed Update Settings:</b> Here you can set the default refresh
	interval for all subscriptions. Note that this setting can be 
	overwritten for each subscription by setting the refresh interval 
	in the subscriptions properties.<br>
	The "At startup" option button allows you to control the update behaviour 
	after startup. You have three possibilities:
	<ul>
	<li>Update out-dated feeds.</li>
	<li>Force update all feeds.</li>
	<li>No feed update at all.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Folder Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_folders_1.6.0.png">
	</p>
		
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Folder Display Settings:</b> With these checkbox you can control
	what Liferea loads into the item list when you click a folder.
	The default behaviour is not to load any items at all. If
	you enable the first option all items of all child subscriptions of the
	selected folder are loaded into the item list. When you enable "Hide read
	items" then only unread items will be loaded.
	<br/><br/>
	Usually you will want to
	enable both options as this allows to quickly read through all unread
	items of a set of feeds.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Feed Icons (Favicons):</b> This button allows you to trigger
	an update of all favicons of all subscriptions.
	</li>	
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Headline Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_headlines_1.6.0.png">
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Reading Headlines:</b> Here you can set the hotkey for skimming
	through all unread headlines.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Web Integration:</b> Here you can configure your favourite
	social bookmarking website. This setting is used when you invoke
	"Post Bookmark" from the item context menu or the HTML view.
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<a name="browser">
	<h4>Browser Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_browser_1.6.0.png">
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Internal Browser Settings:</b> Here you can configure two
	things. First you can specify whether
	or not Liferea should open clicked links in the configured 
	external browser or in the internal browser. The second option
	allows you to switch off Javascript.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>External Browser Settings:</b> When you click links in then 
	item HTML view Liferea launches the a browser command you can
	define with this preferences. The first option button is to
	select your favourite browser or "Manual" for a user defined
	browser command. With the second option button you specify
	how the link is opened inside the previously selected browser.<br>
	<br>
	Only when selecting "Manual" as browser you can enter a 
	browser command in the command entry. When entering a command
	don't forget to include a <i>"%s"</i> within the command which
	will be replaced with the URL that was clicked. Please keep in 
	mind to double quote the place holder to avoid shell problems 
	with the hash character (#) when launching the browser.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>GUI Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_gui_1.6.0.png">
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Notification Settings:</b> 
	The first option allows you to enable a notification popup
	window which present a list of the titles of new headlines
	of updated subscriptions.	
	<br/><br/>
	Enable the second checkbox if you 
	want to use the notification area feature. This feature is also 
	known as system tray icon. The program will add a icon to the active 
	notification area application (as provided for GNOME and KDE) which 
	will change when new items arrive and 'll be reset as soon the program 
	is used again. The icon can be used to show the program window if 
	currently hidden or hide the program window if it is visible.
	<br/><br/>
	There are two additional option which can be used to modify the
	tray icon behaviour as there is no common default behaviour among
	applications using tray icons.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Menu Settings:</b> Here you can select whether you want to
	display both menu bar and tool bar or only one of them. Additionally
	can influence the toolbar button detail.
	</li>	
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Proxy Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_proxy_1.6.0.png">
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>HTTP Proxy Server:</b> Here you can specify how Liferea
	should determine the proxy configuration. The suggested default
	configuration is to figure it out automatically from the 
	environment variables and the GNOME configuration.
	<br />
	<br />
	If Liferea incorrectly detects the proxy or you want to configure
	a different proxy then you should use the "No Proxy" or "Manual Setting"
	option.
	<br />
	<br />
	There is currently no SOCKS support.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Enclosures Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_enclosures_1.6.0.png">
	</p>

	<p>
	This tab allows you to configure how Liferea should handle
	enclosures. If you are still unsure what enclosures are
	about please read the <a href="enclosures_en.html">Enclosures/Podcasting</a>
	section first.
	</p>

	<a name="enclosures">

	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Downloading Enclosures:</b> Here you specify which download
	tool Liferea should use to download enclosures and in which path
	the downloaded files should be saved in.
	<br/><br/>
	When you have problems downloading enclosures please ensure
	you have installed the configured download tool and that it is
	working correctly when you run it on the command line.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Opening Enclosures:</b> Using the "Properties" and "Delete" button
	you can edit the list of known enclosures types. Typically you only
	want to do this if you want to remove or change program associations.
	You don't need to create this definitions manually because Liferea
	will create a new one and ask you which program to use when you 
	open or save a type of enclosures.
